# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
We worked with the MNIST dataset.
This dataset contains 60,000 images of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. Our goal is to recognize the handwritten numbers by building a CNN.
After defining this model, we use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer and cross- entropy loss to compile the model.
